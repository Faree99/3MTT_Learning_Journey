                <p>"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
                    I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. 
                   I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, 
                   I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

                <p>"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. 
                    I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. 
                    I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about 
                    the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never
                     had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my 
                     learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to 
                     it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly
                     helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"</p>

                    Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy.</h1>
                <p>"The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing.
                     The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a 
                     capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. 
                    You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people."</p>
